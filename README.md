### CS 2050 Labs

These labs are the raw programs I submitted in CS2050 Algorithm and Design 2. They are designed to showcase my performance in a 2.5 hour lab. Although few are not perfect, I still managed to get 100% on majority of these projects. Please note that some of the work may be unpolished due to the time restraint of the labs.

### Personal Projects

These are programs done in my free time. They are interests of mine but are also intended to showcase more skills to employers.
